## Reflections and Comments

### Reflections

Walk through what your code is doing to find where it breaks. Reading code along the way really helps you keep track of things.

Thought I had a handle on how grid works... I apparantly do not. Need to practice more with it to get layouts looking how I want. At this time, I'm way more comfortable with using flexbox.

### Comments

Thanks ben for doing some paired programming with me this week, and also helping troubleshoot places where my code went wrong.
